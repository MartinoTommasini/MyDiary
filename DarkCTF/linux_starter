Description: ssh wolfie@linuxstarter.darkarmy.xyz -p 8001 password : wolfie
find the flag



I connected through ssh to the user, port and address above:
ssh wolfie@linuxstarter.darkarmy.xyz -p 8001 password : wolfie

You are not allowed to use ls command to list the files. So I search the available commands with "help".
Since cd is an accessible command, I used it to discover the content of the filesystem (using TAB and autocompletion). 
Eventually, I found the flag in imp/flag.txt. I displayed the flag using:
cat imp/flag.txt
