Simple binary program to exploit.

TRIALS
I tried with strings to print the printable characters but no results.
Then I used ltrace to trace the execution of the executable. Thanks to this program, a strcmp can be spotted, revealing the second term of comparison. This string is the password promped by the program.

SOLUTION
ltrace
