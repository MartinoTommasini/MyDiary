## Solution

We know that g^x is a square if g^x^((p-1)/2)==1.  
In addition we know that if g^x is a square, then the exponent x is even.  

1. Find whether x is even or odd (in our case even)
2. Since x is even we know that:
    - v is odd only if rx+v is odd (means g^((rx+v)) is not a square.
    - v is even only if rx+v is even (means g^((rx+v)) is a square.


V indicate the vote of the voter:  
- even if the vote is for candidate 1
- odd if the vote is for candidate 2
