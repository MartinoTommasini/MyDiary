Here there's a little collection of HTB machines/challenges solved by me.  
In each box there's a little explanation of what I tried and how I solved the machine/challenge eventually.  
The solutions are not straight to the point but reflect the way I approached and solved the box/chall.

Note: Active machines will be available only once they are retired, as for HTB policy
