# Web Security

In this repo I'll go through the Web Application Security Labs created by PortSwigger. It is meant for me to keep track of the challenges I solve.   
And most important: Writing down and explaining the steps I take, help me to deeper learn the concepts.

The Labs will focus on the main Web vulnerabilities.

The solutions for each lab are also available in the PortSwigger website. Here I will only present how I approached and solved the lab.
